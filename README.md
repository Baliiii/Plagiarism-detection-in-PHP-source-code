Bachelor-Thesis
===============
The main goal of this thesis is to develop a system for detecting plagiarism in sets of student
assignments written in PHP language. Plagiarism is viewed as a form of code obfuscation
where students deliberately perform semantics preserving transformations of an original
working version to pass it of as their own. In order to detect such obfuscations we develop
a tool in which we attempt to find transformations that have been applied, using several
techniques and algorithms.
